                <p>The implemented program is a football premiere league management application that
                    consists of two main components namely the Command line interface and the GUI application.
                    The CLI applications allows users to create a new premiere league manager by adding
                    new clubs and adding played matches. It also allows users to delete clubs, view
                    statistics of clubs, view premiere league table, save league details to file as well
                    as load details from file. The GUI application extends the CLI application by allowing
                    users to view the league table, sort table by points, wins and goals scored. It also
                    gives the user the option to view played matches, generate random matches, sort match
                    list by date and search matches played within a specific date.</p>

                        Train consists of forty two seats in the AC Compartment from Colombo to Badulla.
                        User can enter a valid option from the menu prompt and select a route, date and
                        enter their name to reserve a seat. Part two of this program simulates passengers
                        queuing at a boarding gate and boarding the train. Train consists of forty two seats
                        in the AC Compartment from Colombo to Badulla. The reservations for the train have been
                        made in part one and stored in a text file which this program utilizes. The following
                        report discusses the passenger queueing program and whether the program is ready to
                        be used commercially.</p>

                        prompts for three user inputs to predict a users progression outcome. At the beginning
                        of each input it asks user to continue or quit. If user continues, they may enter more
                        values. If user quits a horizontal histogram is printed. Vertical histogram prompts for
                        three user inputs to predict a users progression outcome. At the beginning of each input

                    <h5>Python - Tkinter</h5>
                    <p>ABC Pairs is a memory game where a player needs to match 6 pairs of 3 tiles.
                        Each tile has a hidden letter which will be revealed when it is clicked. Playing
                        is simple you turn over a tile by clicking it and you must click another to try
                        to match it. A player will get to click two tiles each turn. If the tiles are matched
                        it’ll remain turned. If the tiles are not matched, they will reset. There are two
                        levels in this game, in level 1 you will have 60 seconds to match all 12 tiles.
                        In level 2 all tiles will be revealed initially for 8 seconds. You will have to
                        memorize the tiles during that time. Each time a pair is matched, the game will
                        indicate it by changing the tile color to green. You will not be able to click those
                        two again. You score 20 points each time you make a successful match. If you fail
                        to match a tile which was previously shown, you score negative 5 times the number
                        of times the tile was shown. At the end of a level (if successful) you score a bonus
                        of the number of seconds remaining.</p>

                    <h5>Java - Python</h5>
                    <p>I have implemented Pig Dice in Java and Python. In this, Each turn a player repeatedly
                        rolls a die until either a one is rolled or the player decides to hold. If the player
                        rolls a one they score nothing and it becomes the next players turn. If the player
                        rolls any other number it is added to their turn total and the players turn continues.
                        If a player chooses to hold their turn total is added to their score and it becomes
                        the next players turn. The first player to score hundred or more points wins.</p>
